A Horizon server may be configured to reject historical requests when the history is known to be further out of date than the configured threshold. 

In such cases, the `stale_history` error occurs and returns a [`503` error code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/503). To resolve this error (provided you are the Horizon instanceâ€™s operator), please ensure that the ingestion system is running correctly and importing new ledgers.

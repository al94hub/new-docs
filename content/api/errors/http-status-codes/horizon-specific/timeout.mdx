The `timeout` error returns a `[504` error code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/504) and occurs when either:
- Horizon has not received a confirmation from the Stellar Core server that the transaction you are trying to submit to the network was included in a ledger in a timely manner, or
- Horizon has not sent a response to a reverse-proxy before a specified amount of time has elapsed. 

The former case may happen because there was no room for your transaction for 3 consecutive ledgers. This is because Stellar Core removes each submitted transaction from a queue. To solve this you can: 
- Keep resubmitting the same transaction (with the same sequence number) and wait until it finally is added to a new ledger, or
- Increase the fee in order to prioritize the transaction.

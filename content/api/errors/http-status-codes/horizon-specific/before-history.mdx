A Horizon server may be configured to only keep a portion of the stellar networkâ€™s history stored within its database. 

The `before_history` error returns a [`410` error code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/410) and occurs a client requests a piece of information (such as a page of transactions or a single operation) that the server can positively identify as falling outside the range of recorded history.
